This game is a remake of the old game called duck hunt from 1984 where you would have a duck appear in your screen and you hit the duck, Each time the duck comes out you would have 3 bullets meaning you only have 3 chances of hitting the duck. every 10 ducks the game gets faster and harder and later on in the game if you miss a duck you would lose the game. You can start the game by clicking the space bar and get to shooting.

I don't have all the of animation and the UGI of the original game
